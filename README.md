# Data Wrangling Experiments Performed during 7th Semester of my Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science and Engineering with HONORS in Data Science sourse
## 1. Handling Missing Values: Identify and fill missing values in a dataset using methods such as mean imputation or forward/backward filling. 
## 2. Data Filtering: Filter rows or columns based on specified criteria, such as removing outliers or selecting data within a certain range. 
## 3. Data Aggregation: Aggregate data by grouping rows based on a specific attribute and computing summary statistics, such as mean, median, or count. 
## 4. Data Concatenation: Concatenate multiple datasets along rows or columns to create a unified dataset. 
## 5. Data Reshaping: Reshape data by pivoting, stacking, or unstacking to convert between wide and long formats. 
## 6. Data Sampling: Randomly sample rows or columns from a dataset to create a smaller subset for analysis. 
## 7. Data Conversion: Convert data types of columns, such as converting categorical variables to numerical or vice versa. 
## 8. Text Data Processing: Clean and preprocess text data by removing punctuation, stopwords, and performing tokenization. 
## 9. Date-Time Processing: Extract date or time components from datetime columns and perform operations such as calculating time differences or aggregating by time intervals. 
## 10. Data Merging: Merge two or more datasets based on common keys or indices to combine information from different sources.
